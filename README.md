## Objectives



## Business Problem
PetSmart Arizona is looking for ways to reduce the amount of sick days that its employees take by encouraging those who do not get flu vaccines to do so. The company does not want to explicitly ask its employees about their vaccine status because that would make some employees uncomfortable and possibly not willing to disclose that information. Instead, PetSmart sent out questionaries to their employees with some demographic and socio-economic questions with a small portion of the questions asking about the person's opinion about flu vaccines, and their day-to-day habits that prevent getting sick from a contagious disease. Our team was tasked to build a model that predicts whether someone got vaccinated or not using the dataset with the results of the survey that PetSmart Arizona sent out to its employees.
