## Objectives



## Business Problem
PetSmart Arizona is looking for ways to reduce the amount of sick days that its employees take by encouraging those who do not get flu vaccines to do so. The The company does not want to explicitly ask its employees about their vaccine status because that would make some employees uncomfortable and possibly not willing to disclose that information. Instead, PetSmart wants to use a model that could accurately predict someone's vaccination status based on some basic input information about that person. Our team was tasked with building that prediction model.
